# Hi there 👋

I’m a competitive programmer who treats algorithms like a daily workout. Most of my code is written after midnight, when the world is quiet and bugs can’t hear me coming. I love sharing documentation so others can follow the same trail without stepping on the same landmines.

# 🚀 Expertise

My expertise centers on algorithms, data structures, and the competitive programming world—where I refine problem-solving under fast and unforgiving constraints. I mainly work with C++, Java, and Python, applying them both in contest environments and in real projects that demand clean, efficient backend design. 

I’m also deeply invested in documentation—rewriting concepts, structuring notes, and breaking down solutions so others can learn without repeating the same mistakes. With GitHub, Linux, and a tidy workflow, I keep my late-night coding sessions productive instead of chaotic—most of the time.

I enjoy building projects that stretch my skills, whether they start as small experiments or evolve into full-fledged tools. Whatever I create, I make sure the documentation is clear, engaging, and genuinely helpful—capturing the thought process, decisions, and lessons learned along the way. For me, a project isn’t complete until the journey is well-documented and ready for anyone who wants to follow—or improve upon—it.
