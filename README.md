> You can check out my [@trihajikhr's todo](https://github.com/users/trihajikhr/projects/5) for a glimpse into what keeps me busy. I focus on clarity, simplicity, and deliberate progress—flexible in thinking but disciplined in execution. I avoid clutter, distractions, and shortcuts, believing that good work is built on patience, consistency, and thoughtful iteration, not on rushing or doing things half-baked.

> _PS: Active on several competitive programming platforms—check out my [algo-crash (coming soon)](https://github.com/trihajikhr/competitive-programming) page for the materials I create, inspired by [cp-algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/) and [usaco.guide](https://usaco.guide/)_.
